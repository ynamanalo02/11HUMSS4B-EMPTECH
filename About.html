        <p>
            Founded as the Institute of Accountancy, Far Eastern University (FEU) has a proud legacy of excellence in education, initially offering a three-year program designed to meet the rigorous standards for the Certified Public Accountant examination. Under the visionary leadership of its first president, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, FEU aimed to be a beacon for aspiring accountants in the Philippines.

            Over the years, FEU has undergone significant expansion, enhancing its facilities to accommodate a growing student body and adapting to the evolving demands of modern education. In response to the needs of a developing nation, the university established the Institute of Graduate Studies to elevate academic excellence through advanced instruction and professional training.
